### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had to create another copy of the original project as on the original I mapped things wrongly while trying to do project 2. Furthermore, I shrank collectionview so I could display collection properly.

### Notes
I initially had issues installing cocoapods and had to look online how to install using M1 processor. Then afterwards, the posters did not load. So I had to ask for help and turned out I needed to add an s to http. This should be added further on to avoid confusion.
